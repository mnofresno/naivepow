# Proof of Work Implementation in JavaScript

This repository provides a simple educational implementation of a proof of work mechanism using JavaScript. It is inspired by [NaiveChain](https://github.com/lhartikk/naivechain), which serves as a great introduction to blockchain concepts.

## Overview

The proof of work algorithm is a fundamental component of many cryptocurrencies. It requires computational effort to solve a mathematical problem, which helps secure the network and validate transactions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this implementation, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pow.git
   cd pow
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

To run the proof of work example, execute the following command:

npm start

This will run the `index.js` file, which generates a proof of work solution and verifies it.

### Code Explanation

- **index.js**: The entry point of the application, where the proof of work is generated and verified.
- **libpow.js**: Contains the logic for the proof of work algorithm.
- **package.json**: Defines the project metadata and dependencies.
